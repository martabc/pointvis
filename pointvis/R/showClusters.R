#' Clustering of Point Data
#'
#' This function allows you to visualize an input point data file (as a CSV) on top of a basemap, as point clusters. As one zooms in, specific data points are revealed with their particular locations. You may additionally select a field to use for popups on the points, so the map becomes interactive. NOTE: the fields for latitude and longitude (coordinates to plot the points) must be labeled as "lat" and "lon" in your input CSV file (without the quotation marks)
#' @param dataset Path to CSV file used as input
#' @param field Optional field that will enable informational popups upon hover (note that if no field is desired as input, an empty set of quotations must be specified (e.g., " "))
#' @keywords point clustering, data visualization
#' @examples
#' showClusters(dataset = "../data/food.csv", field = STORE_NAME)
#' @return A map of the points clustered based on proximity
#' @export
