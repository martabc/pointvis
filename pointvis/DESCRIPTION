Description: This package includes three basic functions, which allow for the visualization of point data from a CSV file (comma delimitted), containing coordinates. The first displays all input points over a basemap. The next groups the points into clusters based on proximity, which, as one zooms in, are visualized differently. The third creates a heatmap, to show the overall trend in the geographic coverage and occurrence of those input points.
